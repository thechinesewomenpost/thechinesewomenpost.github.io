title: About Us 关于我们
permalink: /about/

We are a team that cares deeply about the well-being of Chinese women and the development of feminist movements in China. We want to connect to those with similar interests and build a supportive community for Chinese women. We also want to use our platforms to share our personal experiences as women, express our opinions on gender issues and raise awareness for women’s rights in China. Although we are not professional journalists, we still hope our content can help the public learn more about the unique challenges and struggles experienced by Chinese women.

​We also feel the need to point out that gender inequality is a global problem, and FEMINISM entails much more than just “women’s issues.” We hope our productions and activities can contribute to the study of intersectional feminism in contemporary society, where more insights can be gained into how factors including race, culture, nationality, class, sexuality, age, geographical location, educational background, and physical well-being are combined together to shape women’s living experiences.


我们是一个深切关心中国女性身心健康和中国女权运动发展的团队。我们希望认识更多与我们有相同兴趣和目标的姐妹，并一起塑造一个支持中国女性的社群。我们也希望通过这个平台分享我们作为女性的个人经历和对中国社会内部性别问题的看法，并让更多人注意到中国的女性权益问题。尽管不是专业的媒体团队，我们仍希望我们平台上的内容可以帮助社会大众增加对中国女性特有的生活经历的了解，尤其是其中的挑战和困难。
      
除此之外我们还要指出的是，性别不平等是一个世界性问题，并且“女权主义”这一议题的范畴远不止“女人的问题”这一话题。我们也希望我们的内容和活动可以帮助增进和改善当前社会对“多元交织性女权”的理解。并向读者们展现种族，文化，国籍，阶级，性取向，年龄，生活地区，受教育水平，和身体健康程度等诸多因素是如何交织在一起影响女性的生活经历的。
